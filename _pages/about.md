I’m a third-year grad student at NUAA, majoring in robotics, with a deep love for computers—especially the Linux kernel. 

I’m also into language learning (English, Japanese, German). On this site, I’ll be posting about daily life, studies, and language learning. 

I hope my posts can give a little help or spark some inspiration to fellow enthusiasts!
